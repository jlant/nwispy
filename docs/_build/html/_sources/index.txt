Welcome to nwispy's documentation!
==================================

*nwispy* is a command line tool for analysing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water resource data 
collected nationwide on rivers and streams by USGS gages and instruments. The National Water
Information System (NWIS) is the Nation's principal repository of water resources data.  Most NWIS
data can be accessed directly at:

http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/

and for real-time data for surface water, ground water, or water-quality data:
